 * Great question! The key here is understanding how the Java Virtual Machine
 * (JVM) interacts with classes and packages during program execution.
 * 
 * While it's true that the JVM is "outside" the package structure, it has
 * special privileges when it comes to executing a class, regardless of its
 * access modifier (such as `public` or default). Here's how it works:
 * 
 * ### 1. **JVM's Special Access Privilege**:
 * The JVM doesn't follow the usual access control rules (like `public`,
 * `private`, or default access) for executing the `main` method. The JVM can
 * still access the `main` method of a class, even if the class is not `public`,
 * because the **JVM doesn't rely on the package's access control mechanism**
 * for launching an application.
 * 
 * ### 2. **Main Method Execution**:
 * - When the JVM runs a Java program, it doesn't need to access the class as an
 * external entity like other code does. Instead, it **loads the class
 * internally** and looks specifically for the `main` method as an entry point
 * for the program.
 * - The JVM can load and initialize classes regardless of their access
 * modifiers because it's responsible for managing all classes at runtime.
 * - As long as the class has a `main` method with the correct signature
 * (`public static void main(String[] args)`), the JVM will execute it.
 * 
 * ### 3. **Why Access Modifiers Don't Affect `main` Execution**:
 * Access modifiers like `default`, `private`, and `public` are enforced by the
 * **Java language and compiler**, primarily to restrict or allow access from
 * other classes or packages **in your code**. The JVM itself is not subject to
 * these restrictions because:
 * - The JVM works at a lower level and can load any class that it is instructed
 * to load.
 * - It has the authority to invoke the `main` method, provided it's `public`
 * and `static`, without worrying about whether the class is `public` or not.
 * 
 * ### 4. **How the JVM Accesses a Class in the Default Package**:
 * - If you compile and run a class that's in the **default package** (i.e., no
 * package declaration), the JVM can still locate and execute it.
 * - The access modifier (`public` or default) does not affect the JVMâ€™s ability
 * to find the class and invoke its `main` method because the class is part of
 * the compiled bytecode that the JVM loads.
 * 
 * ### Example Breakdown:
 * ```java
 * class DefaultPackage {
 * 
 * public static void main(String[] args) {
 * System.out.println("arun");
 * }
 * 
 * }
 * ```
 * - The class `DefaultPackage` has **default (package-private) access**,
 * meaning that **other Java code outside the same package cannot access it
 * directly**.
 * - The `main` method is `public`, which means the JVM can invoke it when it
 * starts the program.
 * - The JVM has special privileges to load this class and invoke the `main`
 * method because it manages the execution environment.
 * 
 * ### **Summary**:
 * - The JVM can access and execute the `main` method of a class, even if the
 * class is not `public`, because the JVM operates outside the normal Java
 * access control rules.
 * - Access modifiers like `public` and default only affect how **other
 * classes** in your code can interact with the class.
 * - The JVM loads the class from the compiled bytecode, regardless of whether
 * it's in a package or not, and it looks for the `main` method to start
 * execution.
 * 
 * So, in this case, while other Java classes outside the package might not be
 * able to access `DefaultPackage`, the JVM can still load it and execute the
 * `main` method without any problem.

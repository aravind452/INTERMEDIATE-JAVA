/*
 * What is a collection?
 * A Collection is simply an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit. It can store, manipulate, and retrieve groups of objects, known as elements. Collections provide a way to manage data in a structured manner, such as lists of items, sets of unique elements, or maps of key-value pairs. Java provides a set of interfaces and classes to represent these collections.
 * 
 * What is a framework?
 * A Framework is a set of prewritten code, or a collection of classes and interfaces, that provides reusable functionalities. Frameworks offer standard ways to implement common tasks, such as data manipulation, without the need to build everything from scratch. They follow a predefined structure and design pattern to simplify the development process.
 * 
 * 
 * What is a collection framework?
 * The Collection Framework in Java is a unified architecture designed to represent and manipulate collections (groups of objects). It provides a standard set of interfaces, implementations (classes), and algorithms (methods) for working with collections. It includes various data structures like lists, sets, queues, maps, and algorithms for operations like sorting and searching.
 * 
 * Collection Interface:
 * It is the root interface of the collection framework that defines common methods like add(), remove(), size(), etc. Subinterfaces like List, Set, and Queue extend this interface.
